            <p>"I have a recent neck herniation, and starting to come here for massage therapy was the best decision I made. Trisha is very attuned to my body and its needs. Each session is uniquely different based on what my body is experiencing, and she does an excellent job focusing on the whole body as one entity. My relief has been significant in my upper back/neck/shoulder areas. I am grateful for her expertise and ability to use different therapies to heal me."</p>

            <p>"This past Monday, I received Myofascial Cranial Unwinding and Therapeutic Reflex Work at Trisha Shemo LMT Massage in Wyoming, PA. Trisha is a very skilled and knowledgeable holistic healer. This experience has greatly helped me after just one session. I look forward to completing this journey as I go forward with more treatment."</p>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"Trisha is the best. One of the things I love the most and that sets her apart from other people I’ve seen in the same industry, is that she offers a ton of different modalities and tools to help with whatever I have going on. She is experienced at healing the body and getting to the root cause. Most times, where I’m experiencing the actual pain is NOT where the problem is in my body. I know that when I have a treatment with her, I’m going to feel a lot better after whichever way. She’s got a ton of training and knowledge and just so many tools. I’ve gone in with a 7 pain level and left with a pain level of 2. Which is night and day!"</p>
